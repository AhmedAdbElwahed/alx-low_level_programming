# Learning about preprocessors in c
> #### What is preprocessors:
> > Preprocessors are programs that process the source code before compilation.
> #### What are preprocessors directive:
> > - Preprocessor programs provide preprocessor directives that tell the compiler to preprocess the source code before compiling.
> > - All of these preprocessor directives begin with a ‘#’ (hash) symbol. The ‘#’ symbol indicates that whatever statement starts with a ‘#’ will go to the preprocessor program to get executed. 
> > - We can place these preprocessor directives anywhere in our program.
 #### The following table lists all the preprocessor directives in C:
 | Preprocessor Directives | Description                                                                    |
 |-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | #define                 | Used to define a macro                                                         |
 | #undef                  | Used to undefine a macro                                                       |
 | #include                | Used to include a file in the source code program                              |
 | #ifdef                  | Used to include a section of code if a certain macro is not defined by #define |
 | #if                     | Check for the specified condition                                              |
 | #else                   | Alternate code that executes when #if fails                                    |
 | #endif                  | Used to mark the end of #if, #ifdef, and #ifndef                               |
